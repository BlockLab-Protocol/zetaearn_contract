## Liquid Staking
ZetaEarn serves as a liquid staking protocol for the ZetaChain PoS (Proof of Stake) blockchain. It provides users with the ability to stake their ERC20 ZETA tokens on the ZetaChain mainnet and instantly receive a representation of their stake in the form of stZETA tokens, eliminating the need to maintain staking infrastructure. Users will earn staking rewards and retain control over their stZETA tokens. ZETA tokens will be delegated amongst validators who have successfully registered and been approved within the ZetaEarn on ZetaChain protocol. 
Our objective is to contribute to the decentralization of ZetaChain and seamlessly integrate stZETA with an array of protocols and DeFi applications on the ZetaChain PoS chain.
